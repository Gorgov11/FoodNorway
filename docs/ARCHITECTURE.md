# FoodNorway System Architecture

## Overview
FoodNorway is designed to collect, process, and present health-related information about supermarket products in Norway. The system consists of several modular components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Web Scraper**: Collects product data from Norwegian supermarket websites (Rema 1000, Kiwi, Meny, Coop, etc.).
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Cleans, deduplicates, and normalizes scraped data.
- **Database**: Stores product data, historical prices, and health scores.
- **Health Rating Engine**: Analyzes ingredients and nutritional information to compute health scores.
- **API Layer**: Provides endpoints for frontend and third-party integrations.
- **Frontend Web Application**: Allows users to search, browse, and compare products.

## Component Details
### 1. Web Scraper
- Technologies: Python (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup), Scheduled Jobs
- Responsibilities:
  - Scrape product listings and details
  - Handle anti-bot measures and respect robots.txt
  - Store raw data for processing

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
- Technologies: Python, Pandas
- Responsibilities:
  - Clean and normalize product data
  - Deduplicate products across supermarkets
  - Parse and standardize ingredient and nutritional fields

### 3. Database
- Technologies: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Responsibilities:
  - Store structured product data
  - Maintain historical price and product changes
  - Support efficient queries for frontend and analytics

### 4. Health Rating Engine
- Technologies: Python
- Responsibilities:
  - Parse ingredient lists
  - Classify ingredients and detect additives/allergens
  - Analyze nutritional content
  - Calculate health scores and sub-scores

### 5. API Layer
- Technologies: FastAPI/Flask (Python)
- Responsibilities:
  - Expose RESTful endpoints for product search, details, and comparison
  - Handle authentication (future phase)

### 6. Frontend Web Application
- Technologies: React.js/Vue.js, TypeScript
- Responsibilities:
  - Product search and filtering
  - Product detail and comparison views
  - Health score visualization

## Data Flow
1. Scraper collects raw data →
2. Data processing pipeline cleans and normalizes →
3. Data stored in database →
4. Health rating engine computes scores →
5. API serves processed data to frontend

## Extensibility
- Modular scrapers for new supermarkets
- Pluggable health rating algorithms
- API versioning for future features

## Security & Compliance
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- GDPR compliance for user data

## Deployment
- Cloud-ready (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD for automated testing and deployment
